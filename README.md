# real-time-violence-detection
real-time violence detection on video content.

This is a demo of a violence detection deep learning model. The model is based on Deepminds [kinetics-i3d](https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d "kinetics-i3d") and was developed using transfer learning.
The model was trained on a dataset of 35512 video clips (64 frame/clip) and produced the following results on the test data:

Accuracy       | Precision | Recall
-------------- | :-----------------: | -----------
91.6%        | 89.58%        | 84.71%

## Running the code
the code was tested on an nvidia GPU with cudnn drivers, it might not run properly on cpu .
####  Commands
